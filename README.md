Simple Neural Network
=====================

A neural network written by someone who only knew a neural network by the
diagrams in popular tech blogs.

Preamble
--------

This project started as a result of the July 2015 London Python Dojo, whose
task was to write an AI that could play Battleships. And Simon Davy proposed
that we on his team use a neural network to try and do this. We assumed there
were going to be easy to use, robust libraries to build and train neural nets.

Turns out PyBrain, the main package to do this, is hard to use. We spent the
entire dojo trying to figure out how to use it and afterwards I discovered that
it was badly fitted to the task we wanted to attempt.

So instead of giving up I looked at the wikipedia page for neural networks and
went "This can't be that hard". Spoiler alert: it was quite hard.

for the help, encouragement and assorted heckling. Thanks to Simon Davy for
putting me on this mad quest.
